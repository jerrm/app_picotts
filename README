           PicoTTS For Asterisk
===========================================

Updated to build for Asterisk 13.

This provides the "PicoTTS" dialplan application, which allows you to use
the PicoTTS TTS Engine with Asterisk. This module invokes the PicoTTS TTS engine
locally, and uses it to render text to speech.

------------
Requirements
------------
Asterisk 13 header files 
Should be OK with Asterisk 11, 12 and maybe others but has not been tested.

sox installed and executable in the default path

$ make install

To install the sample configuration file, issue the following command after
the 'make install' command:

$ make samples

Usage
-----
PicoTTS(text.language[,intkeys]) This will invoke the PicoTTS TTS engine, send a text
string,get back the resulting waveform and play it to the user, allowing any given
interrupt keys to immediately terminate and return the value, or 'any' to
allow any number back.
